# Segment Metrics dbt Package ([Docs](https://housewarehq.github.io/dbt_segment_metrics)) 

This package is built on top of [dbt-labs-segment package](https://github.com/dbt-labs/segment) which 
* Performs "user stitching" to tie all events associated with a cookie to the same user_id
* Transforms pageviews into sessions ("sessionization")

# üõë Few things to keep in mind
These packages are under active development and are expected to change with dbt metrics as it evolves over time. As of now, dbt metrics requires users to define models to calculate metrics and these models are persisted on the warehouse. Keeping this in mind, we have currently modelled our packages such that metrics and the models calculating these metrics have a 1:1 mapping, which is why you will see multiple metrics for the same conceptual metric entity accounting for different time grains and dimensions. In future, with the roll out of dbt Server and evolution of dbt metrics, we expect to streamline our packages to remove these redundancies. 

The metrics in these packages are transformed on top of source data ETL'd via Fivetran to your warehouse. Make sure you have connected your SaaS source with Fivetran for the packages to work properly. 

# üì£ What does this dbt package do?
This package provides pre-built metrics for Segment data from [Fivetran's connector](https://www.fivetran.com/connectors/segment). It uses data in the format described by [this schema information](https://fivetran.com/docs/events/segment#schemainformation).

This package enables you to access commonly used metrics on top of Segment Event Data.

## Metrics 

This package contains transformed models built on top of [dbt-labs Segment](https://github.com/dbt-labs/segment). A dependency on the referred package is declared in this package's `packages.yml` file, so it will automatically download when you run `dbt deps`. 

The metrics offered by this package are described below
(All metrics are available at daily and monthly granularity)
| **metric**                          | **description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

# üéØ How do I use the dbt package?
## Step 1: Prerequisites
To use this dbt package, you must have the following:
- At least one Fivetran segment connector syncing data into your destination. 
- A **BigQuery**, **Snowflake**, **Redshift**, or **PostgreSQL** destination.

## Step 2: Install the package

Check [dbt Hub](https://hub.getdbt.com/) for the latest installation instructions, or [read the dbt docs](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/package-management) for more information on installing packages.

Include in your `packages.yml`

```yaml
packages:
  - git: "https://github.com/HousewareHQ/dbt_segment_metrics.git"
    revision: v1.0.0
```

## Step 3: Define database and schema variables

By default, this package will look for your Segment data in the `fivetran_segment` schema of your [target database](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/running-a-dbt-project/using-the-command-line-interface/configure-your-profile). If this is not where your Segment data is, please add the following configuration to your `dbt_project.yml` file:

```yml
# dbt_project.yml

...
config-version: 2

vars:
  segment__source: your_database_name
  segment_schema: your_schema_name
```

## Step 4: Separate metrics into different schema

By default, this package will compute all the metrics in your `target` schema inside `target` database. It's a good practice to add a suffix to your schema defining what source the metrics are coming from 
Go to your `dbt_project.yml` file
```yml
# dbt_project.yml

...
config-version: 2

models:
  segment_metrics:
    +schema: segment_metrics
```
# üóÑ Which warehouses are supported?
