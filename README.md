# Segment Metrics dbt Package ([Docs](https://housewarehq.github.io/dbt_segment_metrics)) 

This package is built on top of [dbt-labs-segment package](https://github.com/dbt-labs/segment) which 
* Performs "user stitching" to tie all events associated with a cookie to the same user_id
* Transforms pageviews into sessions ("sessionization")

# üì£ What does this dbt package do?
This package provides pre-built metrics for Segment data from [Fivetran's connector](https://www.fivetran.com/connectors/segment). It uses data in the format described by [this schema information](https://fivetran.com/docs/events/segment#schemainformation).

This package enables you to access commonly used metrics on top of Segment Event Data.

## Metrics 

This package contains transformed models built on top of [dbt-labs Segment](https://github.com/dbt-labs/segment). A dependency on the referred package is declared in this package's `packages.yml` file, so it will automatically download when you run `dbt deps`. 

The metrics offered by this package are described below

| **metric**                          | **description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

# üéØ How do I use the dbt package?
## Step 1: Prerequisites
To use this dbt package, you must have the following:
- At least one Fivetran segment connector syncing data into your destination. 
- A **BigQuery**, **Snowflake**, **Redshift**, or **PostgreSQL** destination.

## Step 2: Install the package

Check [dbt Hub](https://hub.getdbt.com/) for the latest installation instructions, or [read the dbt docs](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/package-management) for more information on installing packages.

Include in your `packages.yml`

```yaml
packages:
  - git: "https://github.com/HousewareHQ/dbt_segment_metrics.git"
    revision: v1.0.0
```

## Step 3: Define database and schema variables

By default, this package will look for your Segment data in the `fivetran_segment` schema of your [target database](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/running-a-dbt-project/using-the-command-line-interface/configure-your-profile). If this is not where your Segment data is, please add the following configuration to your `dbt_project.yml` file:

```yml
# dbt_project.yml

...
config-version: 2

vars:
  segment__source: your_database_name
  segment_schema: your_schema_name
```
